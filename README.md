This Repo Contains the solution of task 1 of Kharagpur Blockchain Society selection task
1.In this task i have first removed issue of duplicated insertion of address now one address will be inserted in array only once
2. Secondly I made a fucntion tranferOwnership by which the deployer can tranfer the ownership rights to anyone with their address,for this i have used a map, this can also be achieved by array
3. At last i have removed the Chain-link integration thus the code became much shorter
